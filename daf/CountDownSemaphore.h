     * @brief A CountDownSemaphore can serve as a simple one-shot
     * barrier that is initialized with a given count value.
     *
     * Each release decrements the count.
     * All acquires block until the count reaches zero. Upon reaching
     * zero all current acquires are unblocked and all
     * subsequent acquires pass without blocking. This is a one-shot
     * phenomenon -- the count cannot be reset.
     * If you need a version that resets the count, consider
     * using a Barrier type.
