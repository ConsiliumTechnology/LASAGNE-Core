    /** @class SynchronousChannel
    *@brief A rendezvous channel, similar to those used in CSP and Ada.
    *
    * Each put() must wait for a take() and vice versa.
    *
    * Synchronous channels are well suited for hand-off designs, in which an
    * object running in one thread must synch-up with an object running in
    * another thread in order to hand it some information, event, or task. This
    * implementation uses a WaiterPreferenceSemaphore to help avoid infinite
    * overtaking among multiple threads trying to perform put() or take().
    *
    * If you only need threads to synch up without exchanging information,
    * consider using a Barrier. If you need bi-directional exchanges, consider
    * using a Rendezvous.
